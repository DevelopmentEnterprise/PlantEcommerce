## PlantEcommerce

This application is marketplace that's structure can be implemented for all types of business!

Some code is not well-organized and has some structural mistakes because it is an educational project)

## Main components
1) User system: Private area with statistics in orders, goods bought, coupons and bonuses
2) Store system: Well-organized statistics, order and goods control, simple file upload, sort goods and orders by parameters, very simple for sellers to edit goods and order statuses, coupons that can be configured from name to discount value. Easy store information edit
3) Cart system: Frontend and Backend parts are working together. Saving cart to database if user is authorized
This marketplace is still developing and some systems eill be integrated with each other

P.S. This project is supported and developed ONLY by myself and noone was involved to help me with it. This is absolutely personally-written project
